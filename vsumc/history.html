            <h2><u>HISTORY OF THE CHURCH</u></h2>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Vale Summit United Methodist Church. 
                Ministered by George Harpold for over 45 years.</p>
                
            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Before the church itself was built, the 
                congregation first gathered in 1853, consisting of residents from the villages of Loartown and Pompey Smash. 
                They gathered in the upstairs of a building in Pompey erected by Miners Lodge No. 82 I.O.O.F. Located at the 
                top of Bunker Hill. The congregation was originally part of the Frostburg Circuit.</p>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">The original church was built in 1889 betwee 
                Loartown and Pompey Smash. The church looked like the other small churches of the time. The interior was plain, 
                contained wood pews, a pulpit in the front center where the minister stood for service. A semi-circular altar was 
                built in front of the pulpit, an area for the choir on the front right side, and an "Amen Corner" on the front left. 
                The Amen Corner was occupied each Sunday by a small group of men of the congregation. They would often be moved 
                during the sermon or prayer period to exclaim in loud voices several short phrases to signal agreement with comments 
                made during the service.</p>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Two pot-bellied stoves, fired with coal heated the 
                church. One was located on the left near the front of the sanctuary and the other on the right near the back. 
                Several spittoons were places around the stove in the back because some of the men chewed tobacco. The church was 
                initially lighted at night with oil lamps before the installaton of carbide lights. Electric lights would eventually 
                replace the carbide lights.</p>
                
            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">The outside of the church had a paling fence along 
                the Loartown side of the property with a coal and buggy shed. Near the church entrance, a hitching post was used by 
                those on horseback or horse and buggy. In later years, an iron fence with irons gates was placed in front of the 
                building, and a parking lot about 6ft above the public road. In the early 1950s, the parking lot land was deeded to 
                the State Roads Commission who removed it to improve, widen, and straighten the road in the area.</p>    

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Sunday services, Sunday School, Prayer Meetings, 
                Bible Study, Women's Christian Work, and revival meetings were all part of the activities of the church members 
                during the early years. Baptisms, marriages, and services for the deceased were also conducted in the church.</p>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">On February 1, 1930; a deed was recorded and 
                filed by James H Scott. The Consolidation Coal Company conveyed "the tract of land near Vale Summit, in Election 
                District No 17 in Allegany County, MD. All the buildings, improvements, and servitudes thereunto belonging or in any 
                way appertaining" to the Vale Summit United Methodist Episcopal Church, incorporated a sum of $100 cash. The church 
                membership gained full title to the land which had been leased for over 40 years.</p>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">A major remodeling was completed in 1940. 
                The work had started 2 years earlier under minister Rev Norris A Lineweaver, James H Scott Sr, James Marshall 
                Albright, and Huffman Loar. The interior was redecorated with new seats and lighting. The pot-bellied stoves 
                were removed, a basement dug, and a furnace installed. A vestibule was constructed in front, the front doors were 
                rebuilt, and the entire exterior was repainted. It took about 50 men and boys from the congregation and community to 
                accomplish the project. Over 500 tons of earth and rock was removed to build the 26 by 40ft basement. The cost of 
                materials for remodeling totaled $2000.</p>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">An all-day re-dedication program was held on 
                Nov 17, 1940 for completing the remodeling project. The day began with Sunday School led by Superintendent, James 
                H Scott Sr. Hagerstown District Superintendent, Rev Dr Harry Evaul spoke during the Sunday morning devotional service. 
                At noon, a picnic style luncheon was served in the newly built basement. In the afternoon, before the re-dedication 
                service, the Arion Band of Frostburg gave a concert on the church lawn. Rev Dr Harry Evaul spoke again at the 
                re-dedication service. In the evening, the Morning Choir of the First Methodist Church, Frostburg sang several sacred 
                songs and speakers addressed those in attendance. $375 was raised in cash and $475 pledged to liquidate the remaining 
                debt for the remodeling work, with $300 left over. Rev Lineweaver conducted the several services.</p>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Joash Day was observed at the church on May 18, 1941. 
                During the Joash celebration, church members were asked to deposit contributions in a chest to raise the balance of 
                money needed to pay the remaining church debt. The money was donated, debt paid, and the bank note burned during the 
                service on June 1, 1941. In the afternoon, a new cornerstone was cemented in place by James Scott and James Burkhart. 
                Rev Dr Vernon M Ridgeley was the speaker. There was also a concert by Arion Band, a hymn sing, scripture reading by 
                Rev Lineweaver, and an invocation by Rev Edgar W Beckett.</p>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">All articles in the old cornerstone were replaced 
                in the new one, along with the names of the trustees at the time, and Rev Lineweaver for his contributions in 
                promoting and completing the remodleing project. A copy of the May 18, 1941 edition of the Cumberland Evening Times 
                was also included.</p>
