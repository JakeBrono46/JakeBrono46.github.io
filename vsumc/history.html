            <h2><u>HISTORY OF THE CHURCH</u></h2>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Vale Summit United Methodist Church. 
                Ministered by George Harpold for over 45 years.</p>
                
            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Before the church itself was built, the 
                congregation first gathered in 1853, consisting of residents from the villages of Loartown and Pompey Smash. 
                They gathered in the upstairs of a building in Pompey erected by Miners Lodge No. 82 I.O.O.F. Located at the 
                top of Bunker Hill. The congregation was originally part of the Frostburg Circuit.</p>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">The original church was built in 1889 betwee 
                Loartown and Pompey Smash. The church looked like the other small churches of the time. The interior was plain, 
                contained wood pews, a pulpit in the front center where the minister stood for service. A semi-circular altar was 
                built in front of the pulpit, an area for the choir on the front right side, and an "Amen Corner" on the front left. 
                The Amen Corner was occupied each Sunday by a small group of men of the congregation. They would often be moved 
                during the sermon or prayer period to exclaim in loud voices several short phrases to signal agreement with comments 
                made during the service.</p>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Two pot-bellied stoves, fired with coal heated the 
                church. One was located on the left near the front of the sanctuary and the other on the right near the back. 
                Several spittoons were places around the stove in the back because some of the men chewed tobacco. The church was 
                initially lighted at night with oil lamps before the installaton of carbide lights. Electric lights would eventually 
                replace the carbide lights.</p>
                
            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">The outside of the church had a paling fence along 
                the Loartown side of the property with a coal and buggy shed. Near the church entrance, a hitching post was used by 
                those on horseback or horse and buggy. In later years, an iron fence with irons gates was placed in front of the 
                building, and a parking lot about 6ft above the public road. In the early 1950s, the parking lot land was deeded to 
                the State Roads Commission who removed it to improve, widen, and straighten the road in the area.</p>    

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Sunday services, Sunday School, Prayer Meetings, 
                Bible Study, Women's Christian Work, and revival meetings were all part of the activities of the church members 
                during the early years. Baptisms, marriages, and services for the deceased were also conducted in the church.</p>

            <p style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">On February 1, 1930; a deed was recorded and 
                filed by James H Scott. The Consolidation Coal Company conveyed "the tract of land near Vale Summit, in Election 
                District No 17 in Allegany County, MD. All the buildings, improvements, and servitudes thereunto belonging or in any 
                way appertaining" to the Vale Summit United Methodist Episcopal Church, incorporated a sum of $100 cash. The church 
                membership gained full title to the land which had been leased for over 40 years.</p>
