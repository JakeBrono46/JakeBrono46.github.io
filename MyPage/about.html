                    <p>My name is Joe Agosti, I am currently 24 years old, born and currently 
                        live in Cumberland, MD.</p>
    
                    <p>I attended Cresaptown Elementary School from August 2001 until June 2007.
                         Then, I went to Braddock Middle School for the next three years from 
                         August 2007 until June 2010. Finally, I went to Allegany High School 
                         from August 2010 until May 2014.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>I then attended Allegany College of Maryland (ACM) in May 2014 and 
                        graduated from ACM in the Spring and Summer of 2016.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>From there, I went to Frostburg State University (FSU) starting in the 
                        Fall of 2016 and graduated in the Fall of 2018.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Since then, I have taken Continuing Education courses at ACM. As well as, 
                        teaching myself some things to keep my brain active while I look for 
                        a job. I have received a Certificate of Completion in the Excel 2016 
                        Series in the Fall of 2019, and another for Creating Mobile Apps with 
                        HTML5 in February of 2020.
                    </p>

                    <p>I enjoy things like watching and following sports, playing video games, 
                        and listening to music.</p>

                    <p>I have also done some volunteer work for some local areas. The Allegany 
                        County Animal Shelter, the Western Maryland Food Bank, and Allegany 
                        Nursing and Rehab Center. On top of that, I help out at Vale Summit 
                        United Methodist Church in Vale Summit, Frostburg. I help to count the 
                        church collection and Sunday School money, pack lunches for Camp Hope, 
                        I help with the ledger, and other things that some of the other 
                        attendees cannot do.</p>
